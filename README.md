# piprepo
Repository for various software, including python CLI apps.
This is a special repo in that it supports Unix-In-A-Sandbox apps, like LibTerm.
The tool used to download packages from this repo will be similar to apt, using a Release file.
This repo is still work in progress, so *use at your own risk.*
