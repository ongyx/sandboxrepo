# Sandbox Repository
Repository for various Python Index Packages and sandman (Sandboxed Package Manager).
This is a special repo in that it supports *nix-In-A-Sandbox apps, like LibTerm and OpenTerm.
The tool used to download packages from this repo will be similar to apt, using a Release file.
(See INSTALL.md for installation.)
This repo is still work in progress, so *use at your own risk.*
